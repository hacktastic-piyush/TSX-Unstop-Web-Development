<h3>Description</h3>
<h5>Creating a portfolio web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap involves building a static website where you structure your content with HTML, style it with CSS, and enhance interactivity using JavaScript. Bootstrap, a CSS framework, provides pre-designed components and responsive layouts to streamline the design process and ensure your portfolio looks good on various devices. This approach focuses on front-end technologies to showcase your work visually and interactively.</h5>
